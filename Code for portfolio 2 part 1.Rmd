1- Describe your sample (n, age, gender, clinical and cognitive features of the two groups) and critically assess whether the groups (ASD and TD) are balanced
2- Describe linguistic development (in terms of MLU over time) in TD and ASD children (as a function of group). 
3- Describe how parental use of language (in terms of MLU) changes over time. What do you think is going on?
4- Include individual differences in your model of language development (in children). Identify the best model.


### Loading the relevant libraries
```{r Load Libraries, include = FALSE}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, lmerTest, lme4, MuMIn,ggpubr)
```

```{r Load Data, include = FALSE}
df = read.csv("data_cleaned_draft.csv")
```

### Characterize the participants (Exercise 1)

Identify relevant variables: participants demographic characteristics, diagnosis, ADOS, Verbal IQ, Non Verbal IQ, Socialization, Visit, Number of words used, Number of unique words used, mean length of utterance in both child and parents.

```{r}
df$Diagnosis = ifelse(df$Diagnosis == "A", "ASD", "TD")

#Subject 66 is irrelavant, because he was only there for 1 visist and does not have an IQ scores or MLU score therefore we exclude him.
df = df %>% filter(df$SUBJ != 66)

#creating a new dataset with only the data from the first visit
df_v1 <- filter(df, VISIT == 1)
# selecting the relevant columns in this new dataframe
df_v1 <- select(df_v1, SUBJ, VISIT, CHI_MLU, MOT_MLU, types_CHI, types_MOT, tokens_CHI, tokens_MOT)
#renaming columns to indicate it is only for visit 1
df_v1 = df_v1 %>% 
  rename("CHI_MLU1" = "CHI_MLU")%>% 
  rename("MOT_MLU1" = "MOT_MLU")%>% 
  rename("types_CHI1" = "types_CHI")%>% 
  rename("types_MOT1" = "types_MOT")%>% 
  rename("tokens_CHI1" = "tokens_CHI")%>% 
  rename("tokens_MOT1" = "tokens_MOT") 
#adding these columns to the big dataset
df <- merge(df, df_v1, by="SUBJ")
df$VISIT.x = as.numeric(df$VISIT.x)
```

Describe the characteristics of the two groups of participants and whether the two groups are well matched.

```{r descriptive stats, include = FALSE}
#making to separate dataframes one for TD and one for ASD
TD_df <- filter(df, Diagnosis=="TD")
ASD_df <- filter(df, Diagnosis=="ASD")
```

```{r descriptive stats, include = FALSE}
#how many children in ASD
length(unique(ASD_df$SUBJ))
```
there are 31 children in the ASD group
```{r descriptive stats, include = FALSE}
#how many TDs 
length(unique(TD_df$SUBJ))
```
there are 34 children in the TD group
```{r descriptive stats, include = FALSE}
#gender of TD
genderf = TD_df %>% filter(TD_df$Gender != "M")
genderm = TD_df %>% filter(TD_df$Gender == "M")
```


```{r descriptive stats, include = FALSE}
length(unique(genderf$SUBJ))
length(unique(genderm$SUBJ))
```
6 females and 28 males in the TD group

```{r descriptive stats, include = FALSE}
#Gender of ASD
genderaf = ASD_df %>% filter(ASD_df$Gender != "M")
genderam = ASD_df %>% filter(ASD_df$Gender == "M")
```


```{r descriptive stats, include = FALSE}
length(unique(genderaf$SUBJ))
length(unique(genderam$SUBJ))
```
5 females and 26 males in the ASD group

```{r descriptive stats, include = FALSE}
#what is their age in the different groups?
df %>% group_by(Diagnosis) %>% summarize(mean = mean(Age, na.rm = T), sd = sd(Age, na.rm = T))

#T-test on age.
t.test(ASD_df$Age, TD_df$Age)

#how many in each group from the different Ethnicity
df %>% group_by(Ethnicity, Diagnosis) %>% summarize(n = n())

#how about ADOS scores at visit1?
df %>% group_by(Diagnosis) %>% summarize(mean = mean(ADOS1), sd = sd(ADOS1))
#t-test on ADOS scores.
t.test(ASD_df$ADOS1, TD_df$ADOS1)

#verbalIQ in the first visit
df %>% group_by(Diagnosis) %>% summarize(mean = mean(verbalIQ, na.rm = T), sd = sd(verbalIQ, na.rm = T))
#t-test for verbalIQ
t.test(ASD_df$verbalIQ, TD_df$verbalIQ)

#nonverbalIQ in first visit
df %>% group_by(Diagnosis) %>% summarize(mean = mean(nonVerbalIQ, na.rm = T), sd = sd(nonVerbalIQ, na.rm = T))
#t-test for non-verbal IQ
t.test(ASD_df$nonVerbalIQ, TD_df$nonVerbalIQ)


#socialization in first visit
df %>% group_by(Diagnosis) %>% summarize(mean = mean(Socialization1, na.rm = T), sd = sd(Socialization1, na.rm = T))
#t-test for socialization 
t.test(ASD_df$Socialization1, TD_df$Socialization1)
```


```{r descriptive stats, include = FALSE}


#number of words used, Number of unique words used, mean length of utterance in both child and parents.
#mean lnegth of utterance, child.

df %>% group_by(Diagnosis) %>% summarize(mean = mean(CHI_MLU1,na.rm = T), sd = sd(CHI_MLU1,na.rm = T))
#t-test on mean length of utterance at visit 1
t.test(ASD_df$CHI_MLU1, TD_df$CHI_MLU1)

#mean num of utterance, child
df %>% group_by(Diagnosis) %>% summarize(mean = mean(types_CHI1,na.rm = T), sd = sd(types_CHI1,na.rm = T))

## Let's test hypothesis 1: Children with ASD display a language impairment  (Exercise 2)

##plotting data
```{r ex2, include = FALSE}
df$Diagnosis = as.factor(df$Diagnosis)

ggplot(df, aes(y = CHI_MLU, x = VISIT.x, col = Diagnosis)) + geom_point()+geom_jitter()+ggtitle("Figure 0 - plotting the data")
```

##making the model 
```{r}
m1 = lmer(CHI_MLU ~ VISIT.x * Diagnosis + (1|SUBJ), df)
summary(m1)
```
##evalute model


##Checking assumptions.

```{r}
plot(fitted(m1),residuals(m1))^2
```

```{r}
hist(residuals(m1))
qqnorm(residuals(m1))
```

#r^2 for the model.
```{r ex2 evaluate, include = FALSE}
r.squaredGLMM(m1)
```
##making growth curves.
```{r ex2 growth curve, include = FALSE}

m2 = lmer(CHI_MLU ~ Diagnosis * poly(VISIT.x,2) + (1|SUBJ), df)
m3 = lmer(CHI_MLU ~ Diagnosis * poly(VISIT.x,3) + (1|SUBJ), df)
m4 = lmer(CHI_MLU ~ Diagnosis * poly(VISIT.x,4) + (1|SUBJ), df)


anova(m1,m2,m3,m4)


ggplot(df, aes(VISIT.x, CHI_MLU, colour = Diagnosis))+ geom_point()+ geom_jitter()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x+poly(x,2), size =1)+ggtitle("Figure 1")
```
#predicted vs actual data
```{r}
q = na.omit(df$CHI_MLU)
#plotting model 2.
plot(fitted(m2),q,
      xlab="predicted",ylab="actual") 
abline(a=0,b=1)
title("Figure 2")
```
#interaction effect modeled.
```{r}

ggline(df, x = "VISIT.x", y = "CHI_MLU",col='Diagnosis', add = c("mean_se", "dodge"), palette = "jco", 
title = "                      figure 3 - Interaction")
```


- A plot of your model's predictions (and some comments on whether the predictions are sensible)
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(VISIT.x, CHI_MLU, colour = Diagnosis))+ geom_point()+ geom_jitter()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x+poly(x,2), size =1)+ggtitle("Figure 4")
```



## Let's test hypothesis 2: Parents speak equally to children with ASD and TD  (Exercise 3)

### Hypothesis: Parental MLU changes: i) over time, ii) according to diagnosis

```{r ex3, include = FALSE}

m11 = lmer(MOT_MLU ~ VISIT.x * Diagnosis + (1|SUBJ), df)
summary(m11)
```


### Adding new variables (Exercise 4)
```{r ex4, include = FALSE}
mq = lmer(CHI_MLU ~ poly(VISIT.x,2) * Diagnosis + verbalIQ + nonVerbalIQ+ (1|SUBJ), df)

mqq = lmer(CHI_MLU ~ poly(VISIT.x,2) * Diagnosis + verbalIQ + nonVerbalIQ+ Age+ ADOS+ Ethnicity + Socialization+(1|SUBJ), df)


r.squaredGLMM(mq)
r.squaredGLMM(mqq)
